## Week 3 project: Bus Mall

## About this project
This project was created during Code Fellows 201 as a study in the use of constructor functions, DOM manipulation, use of the canvas element and Chart.js in particular, and JSON and local storage.
## Features
This project features a constructor function that produces new product objects which are stored in an array. These objects contain an image property, 3 of which are randomly selected to be rendered in the DOM. Event listeners are used to manage clicks, with info stored about the frequency with which images are clicked, and that info is presented in a chart after the clicking sequence is completed. 
## Contributors
This project was created by me, Laura Antonius, with the guidance of instructors and TAs at Code Fellows in Seattle.
## Licensing
The code in this project is licensed under MIT license.
